*TaskMaster - Collaborative Task Management App*

Worked collaboratively with a team of five to develop a comprehensive task management application, akin to Trello, using **ReactJS** for the front-end, **Angular** for advanced UI components, and **MySQL** for efficient data management. The project involved designing and implementing detailed wireframes and user models, including UserModel, WorkspaceModel, BoardModel, and TaskModel, to handle various aspects of user and task data. The application was built to support over 1,000 active users, offering a seamless and responsive experience. Key achievements include a 25% increase in user engagement within the first three months due to intuitive interfaces and streamlined workflows. The collaborative effort ensured high-quality development and successful deployment of the application.
